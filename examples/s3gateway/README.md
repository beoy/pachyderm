# S3 gateway examples

Pachyderm includes an [S3 gateway](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/deploy-manage/manage/s3gateway/) that enables you to interact with PFS storage through an HTTP application programming interface (API) that imitates the Amazon S3 Storage API. With the Pachyderm S3 gateway, you can interact with Pachyderm through tools and libraries designed to work with object stores.
